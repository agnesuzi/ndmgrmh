Here you can find Stata code for our paper "Home-Country Natural Disasters and Mental Health of Migrants", published in the Oxford Bulletin of Economics and Statistics. 

This paper was completed using data collected through the 45 and Up Study (www.saxinstitute.org.au). The 45 and Up Study is managed by the Sax Institute in collaboration with major partner Cancer Council NSW; and partners: the National Heart Foundation of Australia (NSW Division); NSW Ministry of Health; NSW Government Family \& Community Services - Ageing, Carers and the Disability Council NSW; and the Australian Red Cross Blood Service. It utilized Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) and Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) data supplied by the Commonwealth Department of Human Services (DHS) and linked to the 45 and Up Study by the Sax Institute using a unique identifier provided by the DHS. In order to access the data, please contact the Sax Institute: https://www.saxinstitute.org.au/solutions/45-and-up-study/use-the-45-and-up-study/apply-for-access/. 
We also used the following two datasets to measure migrant exposure to natural disasters and terrorist attacks in their home countries. 
1.	EM-DAT, The International Disaster Database, maintained by the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED) at the School of Public Health of the UniversitÃ© Catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium. To access visit: https://public.emdat.be/
2.	the Global Terrorism Database, made available by The National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START) at the University of Maryland. To access visit: https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/contact/download

Here we provide all the code (Stata do-files) to clean the data and to produce the results. The two main files are:
1.	hcshocks_d12_230929_cl.do (for data cleaning and running auxiliary regressions)
2.	hcshocks_da13_231214_cl.do (for estimating results and producing tables and figures)

The rest of the files are supplementary and used within the main files. We also provide the Excel files with the publicly available data.
